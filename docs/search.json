    "text": "The study of marine species and their movements has become increasingly important in recent years due to the growing concern over human impacts on marine ecosystems. Sharks, in particular, are of great interest due to their importance as apex predators and their susceptibility to overfishing and habitat loss. One species of shark that has received attention in recent years is the Mustelus asterias, commonly known as the starry smooth-hound shark.\nTo better understand the behavior and movements of Mustelus asterias, the present study utilized acoustic detection data collected from a network of 35 permanently installed acoustic receiver stations in the Eastern Scheldt. These receiver stations were arranged in two north-south gates, with a distance of approximately 1 km between each receiver. The deployment of acoustic receiver stations allowed for continuous monitoring of the acoustic tags affixed to adult individuals of Mustelus asterias."

    "section": "Data collection",
    "text": "Data collection\nIn 2018 and 2019, a total of 30 adult individuals of Mustelus asterias were equipped with Acoustic Data Storage Tags (ADST) that emit acoustic signals and can be detected by the acoustic receivers when within a range of approximately 200 meters. The use of ADSTs allowed for long-term monitoring of individual sharks, with each tag having a lifespan of approximately 500 days. One key feature of the ADSTs is that, in addition to emitting acoustic signals, they also transmit the current depth of the tagged animal for each detection. This feature provides valuable information on the vertical movements of the sharks and allows researchers to investigate factors that may influence their behavior, such as changes in water temperature or prey availability.\nOver the two-year study period, the acoustic receivers detected approximately 10,000 instances of the tagged individuals. The data set provides valuable insight into the behavior and movement patterns of Mustelus asterias in the Eastern Scheldt region. For example, the data show that individuals exhibit site fidelity, with some individuals remaining in the same location for extended periods of time, while others exhibit more extensive movements throughout the region.\nOverall, the acoustic detection data collected in this study provides a wealth of information on the behavior and movements of Mustelus asterias in the Eastern Scheldt region. The data can be used to inform conservation and management efforts for this species, and can also contribute to our understanding of the broader ecological processes that shape marine ecosystems."

Such data enables researchers to accurately characterize the estuary’s topography and thus evaluate its hydraulic and ecological functions.\nMoreover, the integration of the EMODnet Seabed Habitats dataset with the Ecotope map of the Western Scheldt can provide invaluable insights into the distribution and abundance of benthic species in the estuary. This integration enables researchers to investigate the relationship between habitat types and species distribution, thereby improving our understanding of the ecological dynamics of the Western Scheldt. Therefore, the combination of these datasets holds great potential for the advancement of research in the field of marine ecology."

    "text": "Estuaries are highly complex and dynamic habitats, vital for numerous marine and riverine species who utilize them for feeding, migration, or reproduction grounds. Estuaries must be protected from human interference to protect and maintain their ecological significance. Unfortunately there is a current data scarcity surrounding estuaries as both marine and riverine datasets do not cover them. This increases the difficulty of studying estuarine ecosystems due to the need to merge and combine datasets.\n\nSo how can we truly understand the impact humans have on estuaries?\n\nFor example fishing and dredging, how do they impact the species living in those particular ecosystems? Perhaps if we understood, for example, the vertical movement of species within the water column, fisheries managers and fishers could be directed with this knowledge to change practice, thereby limiting the number of non-target, endangered and protected species caught as bycatch."

    "text": "The Methods\nIn order to investigate the behavior of the starry smooth-hound shark, the utilization of acoustic tags was employed to extract comprehensive data from multiple individuals. This methodology was chosen due to its effectiveness in obtaining detailed information regarding the behavioral patterns of the subject. By using acoustic tags, various auditory signals produced by the species can be recorded and monitored, providing insights into its activities, movements, and interactions with the environment. Consequently, the use of acoustic tags as a research tool presents an optimal approach to gather significant data for a comprehensive analysis of the behavioral patterns of the species under study.\n\nData Collection\nIn 2018 and 2019, 30 sharks (19 females and 11 males) were equipped with Acoustic Data Storage Tags (ADST), which comprise an acoustic tag and a data storage tag. Fourteen of the female sharks were detected at receiver stations located in the coastal area at the mouth of the Western Scheldt, a part of the Permanent Belgian Acoustic Receiver Network (PBARN). The presence or absence of the animals from the receiver in a vertical range was determined by the transmission of either a depth or temperature value per detection. One of the 14 detected female sharks had a recovered tag, which allowed access to the complete pressure and temperature log, recording every 120 seconds.\nThis study represents the beginning of our research efforts to investigate the complexities of species-specific ecological dynamics and the intricate interplay between various environmental factors. Although this work serves as a preliminary case study, our ultimate goal is to broaden the scope of our investigation to include other species and ecosystems, thus enabling a more comprehensive understanding of ecological processes."

    "text": "(Mustelus asterias Cloquet, 1819)\n\nElasmobranchii (sharks and rays) > Carcharhiniformes (Ground sharks) > Triakidae (Houndsharks)\n\nSharks, belonging to the Elasmobranchii class, are cartilaginous fish that have been around for more than 400 million years. Within this class, sharks are further classified under the Carcharhiniformes order, which is characterized by ground sharks. Specifically, sharks in the Triakidae family, also known as houndsharks, belong to this order.\nHound Sharks are medium-sized sharks that can grow up to 1.4 meters in length. They have a slender body with a pointed snout and large eyes, making them efficient hunters in their marine environment. Their skin is covered with small, star-shaped dermal denticles, which provides them with a unique texture and gives them their common name of “starry ’’ smooth-hound.\nIn terms of reproduction, houndsharks use a reproductive mode called “aplacental viviparity”. This mode of reproduction is common among most shark species, where the embryos develop in eggs within the female’s uterus and are nourished by the yolk sac until birth. The gestation period for houndsharks lasts for approximately 10 months, with litter sizes ranging from 7 to 15 pups every 2 years. Interestingly, houndsharks show a high degree of sexual dimorphism, where females are larger than males, and they reach sexual maturity at around 4-5 years of age.\nOverall, the biology of houndsharks is fascinating, and their unique characteristics, including their classification, morphology, and reproductive biology, make them a topic of interest among marine biologists and shark enthusiasts alike."

    "text": "Ecology\nMustelus asterias, commonly referred to as the starry smooth-hound shark, is a fascinating demersal species that is widely distributed throughout the Northeast Atlantic region, from the British Isles and North Sea. These sharks are typically bottom-dwellers, often found in sandy or muddy coastal waters, estuaries, and bays, with a depth range of 0 to 350 meters.\nThe starry smooth-hound shark’s diet is predominantly crustaceans, including hermit crabs (Pagurus bernhardus), flying crabs (Liocarcinus holsatus), edible crabs (Cancer pagurus), and velvet swimming crabs (Necora puber). Despite their status as a near-threatened species, these sharks play a vital ecological role in the marine ecosystem, serving as both predator and prey.\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List Status has classified Mustelus asterias as “Near Threatened” (NT) as of August 4, 2020, indicating the significant risks to their population due to several factors, including fishing bycatch, habitat destruction, and pollution. As a result, effective conservation measures are necessary to ensure the long-term survival of this species.\nAmong the most significant threats to the starry smooth-hound shark is bycatch, which refers to the unintentional capture of non-target species during fishing activities. The increasing demand for seafood has led to more fishing activities, making it increasingly difficult to avoid catching non-target species such as sharks. Habitat destruction is also a major threat, resulting from the expansion of human activities such as coastal development, dredging, and sand mining, which can lead to the degradation or complete loss of their habitat.\nPollution is yet another significant threat, with the accumulation of toxins and other harmful substances in the environment leading to the disruption of the ecosystem and the food chain. For instance, plastic pollution in the ocean, which is a growing concern, poses a significant risk to the starry smooth-hound shark’s survival.\nIn conclusion, the starry smooth-hound shark is a crucial species in the marine ecosystem. However, their population is currently under threat from several factors, including bycatch, habitat destruction, and pollution. Effective conservation measures are, therefore, essential to ensure their long-term survival and the ecological integrity of our oceans."

    "text": "Occurrence in the study area\nThe Scheldt river, located in the northern region of Europe, is known for its diverse and thriving aquatic ecosystem, which supports a variety of fish species. One such species that has recently caught the attention of marine biologists and researchers is the Mustelus asterias, commonly referred to as the starry smooth-hound shark.\nDespite being present in the Northeast Atlantic, the occurrence of the starry smooth-hound shark in the Scheldt river is not widely known. However, studies conducted in recent years have revealed that the Scheldt Estuary is home to a significant population of adult female M.asterias, which measure approximately one meter in total length. These individuals are mostly observed between the months of April and October, and their presence in the estuary has piqued the interest of researchers, who seek to better understand their behavior and ecology.\nOne hypothesis that has emerged is that the Scheldt Estuary serves as a potential breeding ground for this species of shark. Indeed, the presence of young pups has been observed in both the Eastern and Western parts of the river, between the months of April and September. It is believed that the female sharks may swim into the estuary to release their young, and then swim out again, potentially returning to the estuary in subsequent years. This behavior is of particular interest, as it suggests that the Scheldt Estuary may play an important role in the life cycle of Mustelus asterias.\nHowever, further research is required to confirm this hypothesis and to gain a deeper understanding of the reproductive behavior and ecology of the starry smooth-hound shark in the Scheldt river. Researchers are keen to investigate the potential impact of human activities, such as pollution and habitat destruction, on the population of this species, as well as to explore potential conservation measures to protect their habitat and ensure their survival in the future."

    "text": "Throughout the course of the Hackathon, our team was able to achieve a number of notable accomplishments that have significantly advanced our understanding of Mustelus asterias and its behaviour within the Scheldt Estuary. One of the most significant achievements was the comparison of the recorded depth of individual Mustelus asterias to the present bathymetry within the receiver range.\nThis analysis allowed us to gain valuable insights into the vertical habitat of the species and how it interacts with the estuarine environment. By comparing the recorded depth of the individuals to the present bathymetry within the receiver range, we were able to better understand the factors that influence the species’ behaviour and the role that it plays within the ecosystem.\nIn addition to this, we were also able to assess the preferred vertical habitat of the species and investigate whether it displays pure benthic or bentho-pelagic behaviour throughout its time in the Scheldt Estuary. This investigation involved examining the species’ behaviour and habitat preferences, which allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the ecological niche it occupies and the role it plays within the estuarine ecosystem.\nThese accomplishments represent significant contributions to the field of marine biology, and highlight the power of interdisciplinary collaborations in advancing scientific knowledge and understanding. By bringing together experts from different fields, we were able to combine our knowledge and expertise to gain a more comprehensive understanding of Mustelus asterias and its behaviour within the Scheldt Estuary.\nFurthermore, these achievements have important implications for the conservation and management of the species and its habitat. By gaining a better understanding of the factors that influence the species’ behaviour and its preferred habitat, we can develop more effective strategies for the management and conservation of the estuarine ecosystem and its associated species.\nOverall, the accomplishments achieved throughout the Hackathon represent an important step forward in our understanding of Mustelus asterias and its behaviour within the Scheldt Estuary. By continuing to collaborate and combine our knowledge and expertise, we can continue to advance scientific knowledge and understanding, and develop more effective strategies for the conservation and management of the species and its habitat."

Such parameters may include seabed habitats, dredging and fishing activity, underwater noise, water pollution, and water levels (tides). Incorporating such environmental parameters would augment the existing data on estuarine species and their habitat preferences, as well as provide a more holistic understanding of the various factors that affect their distribution and abundance.\nMoreover, the study’s methodology is versatile and can be applied to all estuarine species for which depth data is available. This can be achieved through data retrieval from storage tags, either acoustic or otherwise. The methodology is applicable to species that are targeted by fisheries, as well as species that are not desired to be caught and thus require avoidance strategies. In summary, incorporating additional environmental parameters and expanding the study’s methodology to other estuarine species can enhance the existing knowledge of these species and their habitat preferences. It can also provide useful insights into the impact of human activities on estuarine ecosystems."

    "text": "The plot shows the maximum and minimum depth of the acoustic detections and the bathymetry, for each acoustic receiver station. The bathymetry was taken from a 200m radius around the station. For the acoustic detections, the amount of detections is noted for each station.\n\nThe graph shows that for quite many stations, the sharks went deeper than the deepest depth from the bathymetry dataset (i.e. the blue bars go deeper than the pink ones). This could have several reasons, e.g. 1) the bathymetry changing over time (although the dataset is from 2019, so from within the detection period), 2) the bathymetry being not highly resolved enough, or 3) the sharks being detected further away than the chosen radius of 200m.\nFor 5 of the stations (11, 13, 4, PVTSS, W6) the sharks are detected in shallower depths than the shallowest seafloor depth. This indicates that some sharks use the water column. The number of detections per station ranges from 2 to 5604, so this biases the comparison. 89% of detections are at station OG10, where detections range between 2 and 25m and the bathymetry ranges between 0 and 20m. The fact that sharks are detected in shallow waters around that station does not rule out diel migration behaviour to feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heatmap shows the percentage of detections and depth measurements falling into 10m depth bins, from 0m to 50m. The heatmap on the top shows the bathymetry/seafloor depth, the heatmap on the bottom shows the depths of the acoustic detections.\n\nHere we can see that for station 11, 13 and 4, the sharks only used the shallower parts (0 -10m depth) around the station, although there were deeper waters ‘available’ (e.g. for station 13, ~75 % of seafloor around the station are 10-20m deep).\nFor stations DL-12, DL-7 and DL-9, we see that the seafloor is never deeper than 10m according to the bathymetry dataset, but that sharks are detected deeper than that (i.e. ~65% of detections are in 10-20m depth at station DL-12).\nStation OG10 has by far the most detections so the results are most robust. There, ~65% of both seafloor depth and acoustic detections are between 10 and 20 m. Only 4% of detections are between 0 and 10m (compared to 32% of depth), indicating that the sharks don’t use this depth much around this station. Instead, ~30% of detections fall into the 20-30 depth bin (but in the bathymetry there is no area that deep around the station). This indicates both that the bathymetry dataset and the acoustic detections don’t overlap very nicely, but also that the sharks are close to the seafloor around station OG-10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure of the depth (m) in function of the Tag Serial Number in the station has the most detections (i.e., ws-OG10). Most sharks range over a depth of -5 up to -25 m. It’s important to notice that shark 1903302 only had 2 detections."
