## Accomplishments throughout the Hackathon
Throughout the course of the Hackathon, our team was able to achieve a number of notable accomplishments that have significantly advanced our understanding of Mustelus asterias and its behaviour within the Scheldt Estuary. One of the most significant achievements was the comparison of the recorded depth of individual Mustelus asterias to the present bathymetry within the receiver range.

This analysis allowed us to gain valuable insights into the vertical habitat of the species and how it interacts with the estuarine environment. By comparing the recorded depth of the individuals to the present bathymetry within the receiver range, we were able to better understand the factors that influence the species' behaviour and the role that it plays within the ecosystem.

In addition to this, we were also able to assess the preferred vertical habitat of the species and investigate whether it displays pure benthic or bentho-pelagic behaviour throughout its time in the Scheldt Estuary. This investigation involved examining the species' behaviour and habitat preferences, which allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the ecological niche it occupies and the role it plays within the estuarine ecosystem.

These accomplishments represent significant contributions to the field of marine biology, and highlight the power of interdisciplinary collaborations in advancing scientific knowledge and understanding. By bringing together experts from different fields, we were able to combine our knowledge and expertise to gain a more comprehensive understanding of Mustelus asterias and its behaviour within the Scheldt Estuary.

Furthermore, these achievements have important implications for the conservation and management of the species and its habitat. By gaining a better understanding of the factors that influence the species' behaviour and its preferred habitat, we can develop more effective strategies for the management and conservation of the estuarine ecosystem and its associated species.

Overall, the accomplishments achieved throughout the Hackathon represent an important step forward in our understanding of Mustelus asterias and its behaviour within the Scheldt Estuary. By continuing to collaborate and combine our knowledge and expertise, we can continue to advance scientific knowledge and understanding, and develop more effective strategies for the conservation and management of the species and its habitat.

## Possible extensions of the project

In order to enhance the assessment of habitat preferences or human-induced avoidance strategies of estuarine species, the incorporation of additional environmental parameters is recommended. Such parameters may include seabed habitats, dredging and fishing activity, underwater noise, water pollution, and water levels (tides). Incorporating such environmental parameters would augment the existing data on estuarine species and their habitat preferences, as well as provide a more holistic understanding of the various factors that affect their distribution and abundance.

Moreover, the study's methodology is versatile and can be applied to all estuarine species for which depth data is available. This can be achieved through data retrieval from storage tags, either acoustic or otherwise. The methodology is applicable to species that are targeted by fisheries, as well as species that are not desired to be caught and thus require avoidance strategies.
In summary, incorporating additional environmental parameters and expanding the study's methodology to other estuarine species can enhance the existing knowledge of these species and their habitat preferences. It can also provide useful insights into the impact of human activities on estuarine ecosystems.
